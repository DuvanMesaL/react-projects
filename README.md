# react-projects
To start the React server and view the page, follow these steps:

1- Open the terminal on your operating system.

2- Navigate to the directory of the project you want to open. Let's assume you want to open the "Duvannetweb" project.

cd Duvannetweb

If you prefer to open the "Web-01" project, replace "Duvannetweb" with "Web-01" in the above command.

3- Once you are inside the project directory, run the following command to start the server:

npm run dev

This command assumes that you have npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Running npm run dev will start the React development server and compile the necessary files.

4- After executing the command, you will see messages in the terminal indicating that the server has started. Typically, you will see a line that says "Compiled successfully" or something similar, which means that the project has been successfully compiled and is ready to be viewed.

5- Open your web browser and go to the provided address in the command line. If everything is working correctly, you should see the page of your React project.

If you don't have npm installed:

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following command in the terminal:

1- First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following command in the terminal:

node -v

If Node.js is installed, you will see the installed version. If you don't have it installed, you will need to download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

2-Once you have installed Node.js, you will be able to use the npm package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. Verify that npm is installed by running the following command in the terminal:

npm -v

If npm is installed, you will see the installed version. If it's not installed, check your Node.js installation, as npm should be automatically installed along with Node.js.

Once you have npm installed, you can proceed with the following steps:

Open the terminal on your operating system.
Navigate to the directory of the project you want to open.
Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

npm install

This command will download all the necessary dependencies for the React project. It may take some time depending on the project's size and your internet connection speed.
After the installations are complete, run the following command to start the server:

npm run dev

Now, you can open your web browser and access the page at http://localhost:3000.
By following these steps, you will be able to start the React server and view the page even if you don't have npm installed, as long as you have Node.js properly installed.

Also, there is an HTML and CSS page available if you don't want to go through these steps and just want to see the page design.
